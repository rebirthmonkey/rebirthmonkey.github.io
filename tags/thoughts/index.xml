      <description>After reading Haruki Murakami&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,&amp;rdquo; the biggest impression it left me with is that the author can truly &amp;ldquo;face himself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The ancient Greeks carved two admonishing sayings on the side of Mount Parnassus, one of which, &amp;ldquo;know yourself,&amp;rdquo; has become widespread. The other can be simply translated as &amp;ldquo;know all of yourself,&amp;rdquo; suggesting that we need to see beyond the surface to grasp the essence.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon Haruki Murakami&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&amp;rdquo; again, where he uses running to discuss life. As he says, writing about running honestly is, in a way, writing about myself honestly. Murakami seeks to use running as a medium to organize his thoughts on spending roughly a quarter-century as both a novelist and an ordinary person.&#xA;The Purpose of Life: Writing&#xA;Murakami&amp;rsquo;s life goal is writing, and supported by running.</description>
