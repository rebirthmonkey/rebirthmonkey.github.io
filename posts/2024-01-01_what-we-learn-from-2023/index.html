2023 was considered the worst year since the last 30 years for China. From the macroscopic viewpoint, the GDP growth rate was limited to 5.2% (the lowest since China’s “reform and opening-up”). From the micro perspective, I find that the layoffs have turned into a widespread trend which was absolutely not the case previously.

<p>2023 was considered the worst year since the last 30 years for China.
From the macroscopic viewpoint, the GDP growth rate was limited to 5.2%
(the lowest since China’s “reform and opening-up”).
From the micro perspective, I find that the layoffs have turned into a widespread trend which was
absolutely not the case previously.</p>
<p>My generation is considered as the generation that reaps the benefits of the times.
Our growth follows the development China.
Even if the life in childhood was a little hard with resource scarcity, this made us bear hardships
and work hard, much like our forefathers.
When we were on teenage, thanks to the economic development and the chinese traditional emphasis
on education,
we had the opportunity to access almost the same educational resources as our Western counterparts,
this makes us global-view thinker like them.
When we started our professional career, the overall economy maintains a double-digit growth
for more than 10 years, in some sectors (like the high-tech Internet where I work),
Chinese companies are subtly revealing a trend to exceeding the related Western competitors.</p>
<p>However,  for no matter which economic entities, their high-speed economic growth cannot continue
infinitely, a lull is always needed, and this appears in 2023 for China.
From another side, the cognitive inertia of our generation is not ready for the economic recession,
that’s why I call 2023 &ldquo;the year of thought conflict&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For 2024 and its subsequent years, I call them the “contraction era”,
we need to adapt our mindset into a “power-saving” mode, lower our daily consumption,
and focus more on our no-substitutable value.</p>
<p>Winter is coming, and it is not only hard but also longer than we expect.</p>
